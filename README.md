## General FAQs
#### Q. How the game has been designed?
`Set up the game environment:` First, created a new project in Unity and set up the game environment. This involves creating a scene, setting up the camera and lighting, and importing any necessary assets.

`Create the player and input controls:` Next, created the player character, which in this case would be a spaceship that the player can control. You would also need to implement input controls to allow the player to move the spaceship.

`Generate meteors:` created a system for generating the meteors. This could involve scripting a random spawn system, where the game generates meteors at random locations in the game world.

`Add collision detection:` added collision detection to the game, so that the player's spaceship can collide with the meteors and vice versa. This could involve scripting a system that detects collisions and triggers the appropriate actions (such as destroying the spaceship or meteor).

`Implement scoring and game over:` Finally, implemented a scoring system and a game over condition. The player would earn points for destroying meteors, and the game would end when the player's spaceship collides with a meteor.


#### Q. What Architecture we used. How we have created the art, source of the assets. Who created the art?
The game was created using a game engine like Unity, using C# as the programming language.

As for the art assets, they were sourced from the web and arranged manually by the us to create the game's environment. The source of the assets were from various websites or online marketplaces that offer game assets for purchase or free download.


#### Q. Future scope of the game? Can you see it becoming a multiplayer game?
One potential future direction for the game could be to add multiplayer capabilities, allowing players to compete against each other in real-time. This could add a new layer of excitement and challenge to the game, as players would have to not only avoid the falling meteors but also compete against other players.

Another possibility for future development could be to add new levels or game modes, which could include different environments, enemies, and challenges. This could provide players with more variety and replayability, keeping the game fresh and engaging over time.

Additionally, the game could potentially be expanded to include more complex gameplay mechanics and features, such as upgrading the spaceship, unlocking new weapons and abilities, and integrating a storyline or narrative.
